# snake_game
A poor man's version of the classic game where you control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer

The goal of the game is to eat as much food as possible without running into the walls of the game area or colliding with your snake's own body.
As you eat food, the snake grows longer, making it more challenging to maneuver.
The game typically becomes progressively harder as your snake gets longer, and it keeps track of your score based on the number of food items you've consumed.

# Here's how a simple Snake game works:

## Snake Movement: 
You control the snake's direction using arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) or other controls. The snake moves continuously in the direction you choose until you change its direction.

## Eating Food: 
Food items (often represented as turtles) appear randomly on the screen. Your goal is to guide the snake to eat these food items. When the snake eats a food item, it gets longer.

## Growth and Scoring: 
The length of the snake and your score increase each time you consume a piece of food. The longer the snake, the higher your score.

## Avoiding Obstacles: 
You must avoid running into the walls of the game area and, most importantly, your snake's own body. Colliding with any of these obstacles results in the end of the game.

## Game Over: 
The game ends when you collide with a wall or with your snake's body. At this point, your final score is displayed.

Enjoy!
